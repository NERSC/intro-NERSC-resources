CPU Examples:
- 01-hello: build and run basic MPI program on CPU
- 02-matrix: build and run a hybrid MPI/OpenMP matrix multiply code on CPU
- 03-xthi: a hybrid MPI/OpenMP code, mainly on CPU affinity settings

GPU Examples:
- 04-pi_targ: build and run an OpenMP target offload program on GPU
- 05-gpus_for_tasks: build and run a CUDA code on GPU, and gpu affinity settings

Please see README files in each example for more details.
